Hello Internet.

For many years, I have wrestled with lack of focus and attention. Would I give myself a diagnosis, I would say I have ADHD. But I hate labels, and I believe we are all a little bit crazy, some more than others, but nobody is normal.

I needed an outlet, a place to put down what is inside of my head.

After several failed attempts at maintaining a Wordpress-site, or pure HTML sites, I gave up. My head was, and for the foreseeable future, would remain a total mess, clogged with thoughts and ideas.

This is one last, final attempt at making a single archive of the world as I see it. If I fail keeping this up, I recon I will never manage to do so.

Set up using hugo, a static site generator, and hosted by github, to ensure it will remain up even if/when I run out of money. Even when I die. Pretty nifty, huh?

I would love to get your thoughts on the matters at hand, and I ask you to send me an email if you have any input. If it is interesting and useful, I may add it to the posts where applicable.

Yes, the content here will be highly **subjective**.
Yes, some of it may also be **controversial**.
Yes, things may get **crazy**.

Welcome to *The world according to Joakim*.
